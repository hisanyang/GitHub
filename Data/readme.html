    <hr>
    <br>
    The <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/">SNLI dataset</a> is not immune to human errors, specifically, misspelled words. In our <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1132">NAACL-2018 paper</a>, we demonstrated that misspelling is the main reason for some of the observed out-of-vocabulary words. We used Microsoft Office spell checker to correct various out-of-vocabulary words that occur due to misspelling in the development and test sets of the SNLI corpus. As a result, 83 and 112 samples from the development and test sets were changed respectively. Table 1 shows some erroneous sentences from the SNLI test set along with their corrected equivalents.
